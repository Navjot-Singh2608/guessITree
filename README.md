# 🌳 guessItree — Animal Diet Predictor with Decision Trees

Ever wondered what an animal eats just by looking at its traits?  
**`guessItree`** is a machine learning project that uses a **Decision Tree Classifier** to predict an animal’s **diet** (e.g., *Carnivore*, *Herbivore*, *Insectivore*) based on its physical features, habitat, and behavior.

## 🚀 Features

- 🔍 Predicts **diet** based on animal characteristics
- 🧠 Built using a Decision Tree model from `scikit-learn`
- 🧼 Cleans and transforms messy data (e.g., speed ranges, missing values)
- 💾 Model is saved and reloaded using `pickle` for easy reuse

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Python 3.10+**
- `pandas`, `scikit-learn`
- Jupyter Notebook for training & testing
- `pickle` for model serialization
